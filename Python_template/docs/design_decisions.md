## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- `bin/`: Contains the main application entry point
- `conf/`: Configuration files and settings
- `docs/`: Documentation files
- `lib/`: Reusable utility functions and components
- `log/`: Application logs
- `src/`: Main source code with business logic
- `tests/`: Unit, integration, and functional tests
