# Chiplet Architecture Template

This repository provides a starter template for experimenting with chiplet-based architectures, unified interconnects, and system orchestration in Rust. It includes configuration files, module stubs, and documentation scaffolding designed to accelerate research and prototyping.

## Features
- Modular chiplet components (core, memory, IO, accelerator) with dedicated configuration and register layers.
- Interconnect abstractions featuring UCIe protocol bindings and message bus implementations.
- System-level resource management and scheduling utilities.
- YAML-driven configuration for chiplets, interconnects, and system deployments.
- Documentation and API references to guide architecture exploration.

## Getting Started
1. Install the latest stable Rust toolchain using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Clone this repository and install dependencies: `cargo fetch`.
3. Run the default binary:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin chiplet-architecture
   ```
4. Execute tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Project Layout
- `config/`: Declarative configuration files for chiplets and systems.
- `src/`: Rust modules defining chiplet behavior, interconnect logic, and utilities.
- `docs/`: Architecture overview and protocol documentation.
- `chiplets/`: Reference specifications and YAML descriptors for each chiplet.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration test scaffolding.

## Extending The Template
- Populate the chiplet modules with real register maps and behaviors.
- Implement protocol drivers, message routing, and telemetry hooks.
- Expand the configuration schema to match your system requirements.
- Wire up CI pipelines to enforce formatting, linting, and verification.
