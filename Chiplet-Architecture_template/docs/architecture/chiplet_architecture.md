# Chiplet Architecture Overview

This document outlines the reference architecture for composing heterogeneous chiplets within a package. It introduces the design goals, chiplet taxonomy, and orchestration strategies leveraged by the template project.

## Design Goals
- Encourage modular composition and hot-swappable chiplets.
- Provide a clean separation between configuration, control planes, and data planes.
- Maximize interoperability across UCIe-compliant interconnects.
- Enable rapid experimentation with scheduling and resource allocation algorithms.

## Chiplet Taxonomy
| Category     | Description                              | Example Traits                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Core         | General-purpose compute clusters         | SIMD width, cache hierarchy        |
| Memory       | High-bandwidth memory slices             | Channel count, ECC support         |
| IO           | External connectivity and off-package IO | PCIe lanes, coherency capabilities |
| Accelerator  | Domain-specific acceleration engines     | Tile counts, supported precisions  |

## Orchestration Layers
1. **Configuration Layer** – YAML-backed definitions describing chiplet inventory and capabilities.
2. **Control Layer** – Rust modules that implement initialization sequences, register interfaces, and health monitoring.
3. **Data Layer** – Interconnect primitives for moving payloads between chiplets with QoS guarantees.

## Extending The Model
- Introduce additional chiplet categories (e.g., security, networking) and corresponding modules under `src/chiplets/`.
- Expand the UCIe stack with alternate PHY mappings or protocol adapters.
- Integrate formal verification or simulation hooks in `tests/integration/` to validate large-scale interaction patterns.
