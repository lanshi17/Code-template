# Architecture Design Document

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the Go Template project, which follows a clean architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer (Handler)

The presentation layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It uses the Gin framework for routing and middleware.

Key components:
- HTTP route definitions
- Request/response handling
- Input validation
- Error handling and formatting

### 2. Business Logic Layer (Service)

The business logic layer contains the core application logic and business rules. It orchestrates the interactions between different components and implements the use cases.

Key components:
- Business rules implementation
- Transaction management
- Data transformation
- Service coordination

### 3. Data Access Layer (Repository)

The data access layer abstracts the underlying data storage and provides a consistent interface for data operations.

Key components:
- Database connection management
- CRUD operations
- Query building
- Data mapping

### 4. Configuration Layer

The configuration layer handles application configuration from various sources including files and environment variables.

Key components:
- Configuration loading
- Environment variable parsing
- Configuration validation

### 5. Utility Layer

The utility layer contains common helper functions and custom error types that are used across the application.

Key components:
- Helper functions
- Custom error definitions
- Common data structures

## Data Flow

1. **Incoming Request**: HTTP request is received by the Gin router
2. **Handler**: Request is processed by the appropriate handler function
3. **Service**: Handler calls the relevant service function to execute business logic
4. **Repository**: Service interacts with the repository to access data
5. **Response**: Result is returned back through the layers and sent as HTTP response

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected to improve testability
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
4. **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are open for extension but closed for modification
5. **Interface Segregation**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use

## Technology Stack

- **Web Framework**: Gin
- **Configuration**: Viper
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with database/sql package)
- **Testing**: testify
- **Logging**: Standard library logging (can be extended with other libraries)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger

## Deployment

The application can be deployed in multiple ways:
1. **Direct execution**: Build and run the binary directly
2. **Docker**: Use the provided Dockerfile to containerize the application
3. **Docker Compose**: Use docker-compose.yml for development with dependencies

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication
- Environment variable based configuration for secrets
- Input validation in handlers
- Secure database connection handling

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable Go applications.
