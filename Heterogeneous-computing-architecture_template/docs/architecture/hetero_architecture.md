# Heterogeneous Computing Architecture

## Overview

The Heterogeneous Computing Architecture template provides a foundation for building applications that can leverage multiple types of hardware accelerators, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. This document describes the key components and design principles of the architecture.

## Key Components

### 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides a unified interface for interacting with different types of hardware devices. This layer allows the application to execute tasks on any supported hardware without needing to know the specific implementation details of each device.

Key features:
- Device management and initialization
- Unified execution interface
- Memory management
- Error handling

### 2. Task Scheduling

The Task Scheduling component is responsible for managing and prioritizing computation tasks. It implements various scheduling algorithms to efficiently distribute work across available hardware resources.

Supported scheduling strategies:
- Round Robin
- Priority-based
- Shortest Job First

### 3. Resource Allocation

The Resource Allocation component determines which hardware device is best suited for executing a given task based on the task's requirements and the current availability of resources.

Supported allocation strategies:
- First Fit
- Best Fit
- Worst Fit

### 4. Computation Engine

The Computation Engine orchestrates the execution of tasks by coordinating with the scheduler and resource allocator. It handles the end-to-end flow of task execution from submission to completion.

### 5. Data Management

The Data Management component handles the loading, saving, and transformation of data used in computations. It provides utilities for working with different data formats and performing common data operations.

### 6. Model Management

The Model Management component provides functionality for loading, optimizing, and deploying machine learning models. It supports various model formats and provides hardware-specific optimizations.

## Data Flow

1. **Task Submission**: Tasks are submitted to the system through an API or other interface
2. **Scheduling**: The Task Scheduler prioritizes and queues tasks for execution
3. **Resource Allocation**: The Resource Allocator assigns tasks to appropriate hardware devices
4. **Execution**: The Computation Engine executes tasks on the allocated devices
5. **Result Collection**: Results are collected and returned to the caller

## Design Principles

1. **Hardware Agnostic**: The architecture is designed to work with different types of hardware without requiring changes to the application code
2. **Scalable**: The system can scale from a single device to large clusters of heterogeneous hardware
3. **Fault Tolerant**: The architecture includes error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Extensible**: New hardware types and scheduling algorithms can be added with minimal changes to existing code
5. **Performant**: The system is optimized for efficient resource utilization and low-latency execution

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building high-performance applications that can take advantage of the unique strengths of different hardware platforms.
