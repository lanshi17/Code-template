# Hardware Abstraction Layer

## Overview

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is a key component of the Heterogeneous Computing Architecture that provides a unified interface for interacting with different types of hardware devices. This document describes the design and implementation of the HAL.

## Design Goals

1. **Unified Interface**: Provide a consistent API for all supported hardware types
2. **Device Independence**: Allow applications to run on different hardware without modification
3. **Resource Management**: Efficiently manage hardware resources such as memory and processing units
4. **Error Handling**: Provide comprehensive error handling for hardware-specific issues
5. **Extensibility**: Support for adding new hardware types with minimal changes to existing code

## Core Components

### HardwareDevice Trait

The `HardwareDevice` trait defines the common interface that all hardware devices must implement:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait HardwareDevice {
    /// Get the device ID
    fn id(&self) -> &str;

    /// Get the device type (CPU, GPU, FPGA)
    fn device_type(&self) -> &str;

    /// Get the available memory in bytes
    fn available_memory(&self) -> u64;

    /// Get the total memory in bytes
    fn total_memory(&self) -> u64;

    /// Execute a task on the device
    async fn execute_task(&self, task: &Task) -> Result<TaskResult, HardwareError>;

    /// Check if the device is available
    fn is_available(&self) -> bool;
}
```

### DeviceManager

The `DeviceManager` is responsible for managing all hardware devices in the system:

```rust
pub struct DeviceManager {
    devices: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Arc<dyn HardwareDevice + Send + Sync>>>>,
}
```

Key responsibilities:
- Device registration and initialization
- Device lookup and retrieval
- Device status monitoring

### Device Implementations

#### CPU Device

The CPU device implementation provides access to the system's central processing units. Key features:
- Multi-core support
- Memory management
- Task execution

#### GPU Device

The GPU device implementation provides access to graphics processing units. Key features:
- CUDA/OpenCL support
- Parallel processing capabilities
- High-throughput computation

#### FPGA Device

The FPGA device implementation provides access to field-programmable gate arrays. Key features:
- Hardware reconfiguration
- Custom logic implementation
- Low-latency processing

## Task Execution Model

The HAL uses a task-based execution model where computations are represented as tasks that can be executed on any supported hardware device.

### Task Structure

```rust
pub struct Task {
    pub id: String,
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
    pub operation: String,
}
```

### Task Result Structure

```rust
pub struct TaskResult {
    pub task_id: String,
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
    pub execution_time: u64,
}
```

## Memory Management

The HAL provides memory management capabilities for each hardware device:
- Memory allocation and deallocation
- Memory transfer between devices
- Memory pooling for efficient allocation

## Error Handling

The HAL includes comprehensive error handling through the `HardwareError` enum:

```rust
#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum HardwareError {
    #[error("Device initialization failed: {0}")]
    InitializationError(String),
    
    #[error("Device not found: {0}")]
    DeviceNotFound(String),
    
    #[error("Insufficient memory: required {required}, available {available}")]
    InsufficientMemory { required: u64, available: u64 },
    
    #[error("Device unavailable: {0}")]
    DeviceUnavailable(String),
    
    #[error("Execution failed: {0}")]
    ExecutionError(String),
    
    #[error("Unsupported operation: {0}")]
    UnsupportedOperation(String),
}
```

## Extensibility

The HAL is designed to be extensible, allowing new hardware types to be added by:
1. Implementing the `HardwareDevice` trait
2. Adding the new device type to the device manager
3. Implementing any hardware-specific functionality

This design allows the system to support new hardware technologies as they become available without requiring changes to the core architecture.
